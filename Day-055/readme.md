# Higher or Lower URLs
## Day 55 - Intermediate+ - \#100DaysOfCode

**To do:**
* Create the higher lower game that we created in Day 14, but now with a real website.

**Requirements:**
* Create a new project in PyCharm called higher-lower, add a server.py file.

* Create a new Flask application where the home route displays an `<h1>` that says "Guess a number between 0 and 9" and 
  display a gif of your choice from `giphy.com`.
  
* Generate a random number between 0 and 9 or any range of numbers of your choice.

* Create a route that can detect the number entered by the user e.g "URL/3" or "URL/9" and checks that number against 
  the generated random number. 
    * If the number is too low, tell the user it's too low 
    * Same with too high or if they found the correct number. 
    * Make the `<h1>` text a different colour for each page.
