# Google Trends and Data Visualisation
## Day 74 - Advanced - \#100DaysOfCode

**To do:**
* Create visualisations for Google Trends

**Requirements:**


1. Tesla, Unemployment, BTC
    * What are the shapes of the dataframes?
    * How many rows and columns?
    * What are the column names?
    * Complete the f-string to show the largest/smallest number in the search data column 
    * Try the `.describe()` function to see some useful descriptive statistics
    * What is the periodicity of the time series data (daily, weekly, monthly)?
    * What does a value of 100 in the Google Trend search popularity actually mean?

2. Data Cleaning
    * Are there any missing values in any of the dataframes? If so, which row/rows have missing values? How many  
      missing values are there?
    * Remove any missing values that you found. 
      
3. Convert Strings to DateTime Objects
    * Check the data type of the entries in the DataFrame MONTH or DATE columns. Convert any strings in to Datetime  
      objects. Do this for all 4 DataFrames. Double check if your type conversion was successful.

4. Converting from Daily to Monthly Data

5. Data Visualisation

6. Tesla Stock Price v.s. Search Volume
    * Plot the Tesla stock price against the Tesla search volume using a line chart and two different axes. Label 
      one axis 'TSLA Stock Price' and the other 'Search Trend'.

7. Bitcoin (BTC) Price v.s. Search Volume
    * Create the same chart for the Bitcoin Prices vs. Search volumes.

8. Unemployment Benefits Search vs. Actual Unemployment in the U.S.
    * Plot the search for "unemployment benefits" against the unemployment rate. 

9. Calculate the 3-month or 6-month rolling average for the web searches. Plot the 6-month rolling average search  
   data against the actual unemployment. What do you see in the chart? Which line moves first?

10. Include 2020 in Unemployment Charts
    * Read the data in the 'UE Benefits Search vs UE Rate 2004-20.csv' into a DataFrame. Convert the MONTH column to 
      Pandas Datetime objects and then plot the chart. What do you see?
