# Coffee and Wifi Project
## Day 62 - Advanced - \#100DaysOfCode

**To do:**
* Build a website that shows your favorite coffee shops and their Wifi connections

**Requirements:**
* The home page should use the css/styles.css file

* The /cafes route should render the `cafes.html` file. This file should contain a Bootstrap table which displays all 
the data from the `cafe-data.csv`

* The location URL should be rendered as an anchor tag `<a>` in the table instead of the full link. It should have the 
 link text "Maps Link" and the href should be the actual link.

* Clicking on the "Show Me!" button on the home page should take you to the `cafes.html` page.

* There should be a secret route "/add" which doesn't have a button, but those in the know should be able to access 
it and it should take you to the `add.html` file.

* Use what you have learnt about WTForms to create a quick_form in the `add.html` page

* Make sure that the location URL field has validation that checks the data entered is a valid URL

* When the user successfully submits the form on add.html, make sure the data gets added to the cafe-data.csv. It 
needs to be appended to the end of the csv file. The data from each field need to be comma-separated like all the other lines of data in cafe-data.csv

* Make sure all the navigation links in the website work.
