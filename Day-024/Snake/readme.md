# Improve the Snake Game
## Day 24 - Intermediate - \#100DaysOfCode

**To do:**
* Improve the [previously created Snake Game](https://github.com/adrianurdar/100DaysOfCode-Bootcamp/tree/main/Day-020-021) to keep track of the high score
* The Snake Game should continue until manually exit

**Acceptance criteria:**
* Same functionality as the [previously created Snake Game](https://github.com/adrianurdar/100DaysOfCode-Bootcamp/tree/main/Day-020-021)
* The game should end only if manually terminated
* The High Score should exist even if the game was restarted
