# The Snake Game Project
## Day 20 & 21 - Intermediate - \#100DaysOfCode

**To do:**
* Create a functional snake game

**Acceptance criteria:**
* **Set title and screen**. The title should be custom and the screen should be black.
* **Create the snake body**.
* **Control the snake**. The snake should be controllable by the keyboard arrows (Up, Down, Left, Right)
* **Move the snake**. The snake should move normally. If it heads to the right it can't go left. The rest of the logical criteria applies.
* **Detect collision with food**. Once the snake "eats" a piece of food, it should grow.
* **Keep track with score and scoreboard**. Once the snake "eats" a piece of food, the score should increase. Display the score on the top of the screen.
* **Detect collision with wall**. If the snake hits one of the side walls, the game should end.
* **Detect collision with own tail**. If the snake hits his own body, the game should end.
