# BlackJack Project

The blackJack project was the first bigger project from the 100DaysOfCode Bootcamp from The App Brewery.

The goal is to create a BlackJack game in Python using dictionaries, lists, while and for loops, and to put in practice basic concepts.

I've decided to complete the game on expert difficulty, meaning the only brief I has was seeing and playing the game at https://repl.it/@appbrewery/blackjack-final?embed=1&output=1#main.py

* The deck is unlimited in size. 
* There are no jokers. 
* The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
* The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
* Use the following list as the deck of cards:
* cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
* The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
* Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
* The computer is the dealer.
