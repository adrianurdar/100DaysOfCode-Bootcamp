# The U.S. States Game
## Day 25 - Intermediate - \#100DaysOfCode

**To do:**
* Create the U.S. States Game

**Acceptance criteria:**
* The user should see a map of the U.S.
* The user should be asked to name one of the states. User input should be case-insensitive.
* If the user guessed correctly, the name of the state should be placed on the map at the corresponding coordinates.
* If the user guessed wrong, nothing happens and the input box should prompt him for another answer.
* In the title of the input box keep track of the number of right guesses (e.g. `4/50`)
