# Cafe API
## Day 66 - Advanced - \#100DaysOfCode

**To do:**
* Build my own API with RESTful routing

**Requirements:**
* HTTP GET - a Random Cafe
    * Create a /random route in main.py that allows GET requests to be made to it.
    
* HTTP GET - All the Cafes
    * Create another GET route that's called /all
    * When a GET request is made to this /all route, your server should return all the cafes in your database as a JSON.
    
* HTTP GET - Find a Cafe
    * Create a /search route to search for cafes at a particular location.
    * The user will make a GET request to your /search route and pass the location as a parameter.
    
* HTTP POST - A New Cafe

* HTTP PATCH - A Cafe's Coffee Price

* HTTP DELETE - A Cafe that's Closed

* Create the API Documentation
