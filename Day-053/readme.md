# Data Entry Job Automation
## Day 53 - Intermediate+ - \#100DaysOfCode
## Capstone Project

**To do:**
* Automate extraction of RE listings

**Requirements:**
* Use BeautifulSoup/Requests to scrape all the listings from Zillow.

* Create a list of links for all the listings you scraped.

* Create a list of prices for all the listings you scraped.

* Create a list of addresses for all the listings you scraped.

* Use Selenium to fill in the form you created (step 1,2,3 above). Each listing should have its price/address/link 
  added to the form. You will need to fill in a new form for each new listing.
  
* Once all the data has been filled in, click on the "Sheet" icon to create a Google Sheet from the responses to the 
  Google Form. You should end up with a spreadsheet with all the details from the properties.
